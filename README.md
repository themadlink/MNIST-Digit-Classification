MNIST Digit Classification is a foundational task in machine learning, focusing on recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. In this implementation, Keras version 2.3.1 with TensorFlow 2.9.3 backend, scikit-learn 0.23.2, numpy, matplotlib, and OpenCV-python libraries are utilized for compatibility and functionality.

The process begins with loading the MNIST dataset, containing 28x28 grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. These images undergo preprocessing, scaling pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and reshaping to fit the neural network's input requirements.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is constructed using Keras, featuring convolutional layers for feature extraction and max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction. Dense layers follow for classification, employing rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions. The final layer uses softmax to output probabilities for digit classes.

The model is trained on the training dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training progress is monitored, and the model's accuracy is evaluated using test data.

Matplotlib visualizes the training history, depicting the accuracy progression over epochs for both training and validation datasets.

The trained model is then tested on unseen data to assess its performance. Additionally, OpenCV-python is used for image processing to predict the class of custom digit images. The image is preprocessed similarly to the training data, and the model predicts the digit class with high accuracy.

In summary, MNIST Digit Classification is implemented using specific library versions to ensure compatibility. The process involves data preprocessing, CNN architecture construction, model training, evaluation, and testing. The model achieves accurate digit recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks.
